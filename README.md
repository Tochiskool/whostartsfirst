# Lucky Game

- On load the game reveals tiles with hidden numbers which change positions on page load.
- You can increase the number of tiles with specific numbers of elements in an array.
- The numbers in the array **do not have to change**
- When you hover over a tile the colour should change.
- On `click` the color should change and a number should be revealed.

* A time should start on click of any of the times.
* **_Hint_** Use started and call it at the top of your evnt listener when you click on the tile.
